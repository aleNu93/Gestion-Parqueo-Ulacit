🚗 Parking Management System - ULACIT

This project marks my first step into the world of programming and development, completed with great effort and pride. The idea was born out of a real-world challenge at the Latin American University of Science and Technology (ULACIT). Despite being a leader in science and technology, certain processes like parking management were still being handled manually, creating inefficiencies.

🛠 Project Overview
The Parking Management System was developed in Python to improve the management of users and vehicles in the university’s parking lots. This digital solution enhances efficiency, order, and the overall user experience.

Key Features:
👥 User Registration: Professors, staff, students, and visitors can register.
🚗 Vehicle Information: Tracks national ID, license plates, vehicle type, and registration status.
📅 Enrollment/Employment Verification: Confirms active status for students and employees.
📍 Parking Lot Management: Monitors available and occupied spots in the parking lot.
⏱ Parking Time Tracking: Records the date, time, and duration of parking.
📊 Data Analysis: Provides analysis of average, minimum, and maximum parking times.
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Guest Control: Special handling for unregistered visitors or guests.
👨‍💻 My Role
Although this project was a group effort, I developed approximately 90% of the code and system structure. For testing purposes, I used hardcoded data for users, passwords, vehicle details, and enrollment verification.

🌱 Why This Project?
This was my first hands-on experience applying logical thinking and programming skills to solve a real-world problem. It sparked my passion for software development, and laid the foundation for my journey in tech.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for development.
JSON: Used for managing and storing data such as user and vehicle information.
Visual Studio: Development environment used throughout the project.
🚀 What’s Next?
This project is just the beginning! I plan to keep building more complex applications and expand my knowledge in software development, data handling, and systems optimization.
